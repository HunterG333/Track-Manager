# Track-Manager
A front end database application for storing and visualizing progress in the sport of Track and Field. The user has the option to insert Athletes and their respective times for different events. With this information the user can create different graphs to visualize progress over time. 

# QT
I reccomend QMake Version 3.1 and QT Version 6.4.2 as that is what I used to create this little project.

# Dependencies
This program is dependent on sqlite3. I reccomend version 3.42.0. Install the source code from SQLite's download page, extract the folder, and drag the sqlite3.c and sqlite.h files into the main folder.
