# Track-Manager
An Front End Database Application for visualizing Track and Field progress. The user has the option to insert Athletes and their respective times for different events. With this information the user can create different graphs to visualize progress over time. 

# Dependencies
This program is dependent on sqlite3. I reccomend version 3.42.0. Install the source code from SQLite's download page, extract the folder, and drag the sqlite3.c and sqlite.h files into the main folder.
